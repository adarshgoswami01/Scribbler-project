# Scribbler_Project
This repository is created for the Front End Group Project 

# Problem Statement

Project Brief:

Till now, you have learnt about the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and fiddled around with some of the notable features of each of these languages. In the upcoming project, you would be creating a front-end of a blogging website. This blogging website will enable the user to create and publish his own articles/posts, register a new user, edit an already existing blog post, add comments on that blog post, add a "like" to any particular blog post and so on. You would be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a basic blogging website.

Goal of this project :

By creating the front-end of a blogging website, you will familiarize yourself with how usually front-end development works in a team. You will be given a set of specifications which you would be asked to meet. You will also be given screenshots of how each page on your website must look like. And towards the end of this project, you would have independently created one part each of the front-end of a blogging website!

Some important points to keep in mind:

1) We recommend having a group of 4 students (or atleast 3) to attempt this project.

For a group of 4 students, we recommend that 2 students should work on Part A, and 1 each on Part B and Part C. 

For a group of 3 students, we recommend that each student works on one part of the project.

Important: The two students who would be working on Part A must share the header class created in Part A because it will be used in Part B and C as it is. Note that students working on Part B/C need to simply import/borrow the header class code from students creating Part A.

2) You will be given a zipped folder (see the end of this page) containing the basic folder structure of your blogging project.

Please note that you must not alter the overall folder structure of the blogging project, otherwise your project might be wrongly evaluated. The root directory will consist of an "index.html" file which will be the homepage of your blogging website.

 
3) The root directory will contain a folder called "font-awesome-4.7.0" which consists of the font files which you can use in your project, although it is at your discretion if you wish to use those fonts, or some other fonts of your choice. Please do not modify/delete this folder.

4) The root folder also consists of the folders "css", "html" and "js". All your stylesheet files must be referenced to and kept inside this "css" folder. Similarly, all the html files (EXCEPT the "index.html" file) will be placed inside the "html" folder. All the script files will be referenced to and kept inside the "js" folder.

5) You can use HTML5 elements for creating any elements on the page.

 

# Github Collaboration Instructions:

One of the team members should act as the project lead, create a master repository for the project, and push the initial code stub to the master repository. After which, the project lead should create different branches for different functionalities to be developed, and share the repository URL with other team members. 
# phani2585 (lead)
=> phanimkms, deepa => Part_A
=> sanjay => Part_B
=> ghanshyam => Part_C
Total 5 contributors.


The other team members should then fork and clone the master repository to their own repository on GitHub, so they can work on a specific branch and make updates on the project via pull requests. Also, it would be the project lead’s responsibility to merge the pull requests into the master repository. It is always a good practice for each member of the team to review a pull request before it is merged into the master repository and give your comments on the pull request to help the project lead.

Lastly, if you are working off a fork, don’t forget to fetch from the upstream repository often, so you can get the latest commits and updates of the various branches in the upstream repository. Also, once all the required code implementation is done on a specific branch and is working fine, then the project lead can go ahead and merge the branch with master repository.

A few additional notes to help your collaboration between teammates:

Use Github to track issues and bugs for the project.

Use Github to conduct code reviews, so each push request or commits are reviewed by another teammate before the code changes are merged into the main repository.

# Version Control Best Practices

Please follow the following best practice as you are using Git and Github to conduct version control of your code. This will make you a more effective software engineer.

Commit often
Make small, incremental commits
Write good commit messages
Make sure your code works before committing it
Let us now begin the step by step process of creating our own blogging website!
